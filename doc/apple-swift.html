    <h1>My response to Apple's claims of innovation</h1>

    <p>Here's the offending page: <a href=
    "https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Introducing Swift</a></p>

    <p>The page claims that "Swift is the result of the latest
    research on programming languages" and goes on to mention that
    "inferred types make code cleaner and less prone to mistakes,"
    which are <strong>a feature <a href=
    "http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/types/archives/1988/msg00042.html"
    >whose roots date back to the 50s</a></strong> and have first been
    famously used in the <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)">ML
    programming language</a> (1972); and mentions that "modules
    eliminate headers and provide namespaces" which date back to who
    the fuck knows; and says that "memory is managed automatically"
    even though it uses reference counting (RC), thus <strong>fails at
    collecting cyclic structures</strong> unless some links in them
    are explicitly declared weak to break up the cycle.  Contrast this
    to garbage collection (GC), which <a href=
    "http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.html">dates back to
    around 1960</a>, has no problems with cyclic structures, and <a
    href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/gcsurvey.ps"> is
    understood to perform better than reference counting</a>.</p>

    <p>(To be more precise, I've been unable to find a good comparison
    of well-optimized RC and well-optimized GC; although the latter <a
    href="http://hboehm.info/gc/myths.ps">has been shown to perform
    (significantly) better for naive implementations</a>.  Most
    research seems willing to dismiss RC from the get-go since it
    fails to handle cyclic garbage anyway.  However, <a
    href="../webapps-js-gc">don't believe lies about GC performing
    badly</a>, and <a href="http://hboehm.info/gc/#further">do your
    own reading</a> if you want to be well-informed.)</p>

    <p>But the killer feature of Swift is, of course, that "you donâ€™t
    even need to type semi-colons."  That's 21st century innovation
    for you.</p>

    <p>Let's look at the bulleted feature-list on that page.</p>

    <h3>Closures unified with function pointers</h3>

    <p>This is a fancier way to say "we support closures, and this
    time the language doesn't have the horrible design flaw of
    treating them and other functions as distinct data types," in
    other words the "unified with function pointers" part is just
    utter marketing bullshit.</p>

    <p>Closures themselves, which ought to be the <strong> only
    </strong> type of function in a language, date back to at least
    1975: <a href=
    "ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-349.pdf">
    the original Scheme report</a> briefly explains how they can be
    compiled to efficient code.</p>

    <h3>Tuples and multiple return values</h3>

    <p>Depending on where you look, tuples are more or less nothing
    but fixed-length arrays, in any case a trivial data structure.
    Lumping this together with multiple-value (MV) returns, by the
    way, shows only the ignorance (or willingness to flaunt and
    deceive) of the author: the whole POINT of MV returns is to avoid
    creating a data structure for the return value and having to
    destructure it again at the call-site; there will generally be
    syntactic support for directly populating a number of variables
    with the returned values, or passing them as the arguments for
    another function instead.</p>

    <p><b>Correction:</b> That's my ignorance.  In a statically typed
    language, working with tuples does not necessitate creating and
    destructuring data structures at run-time.</p>

    <p>This strategy dates back at least to 1994; probably (much?)
    older but I can't be arsed to look around, my reference of 1994 is
    ANSI Common Lisp (CL).  You can browse the <a href=
    "http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/"> Common
    Lisp HyperSpec</a> (CLHS) online, which is essentially ANSI CL in
    HTML form.</p>

    <p>Scheme also has had MV returns standardized in <a href=
    "http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/ftpdir/scheme-reports/r5rs.ps">
    R5RS</a> which is from 1998.</p>

    <h3>Generics</h3>

    <p>These date back at least to the Common Lisp Object System
    (CLOS), again from ANSI Common Lisp.  See <a href=
    "http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw50/CLHS/Body/m_defgen.htm"
    >defgeneric</a> in the CLHS.</p>

    <h3>Fast and concise iteration over a range or collection</h3>

    <p>You mean like in pretty much any programming language since
    FORTRAN?</p>

    <p>I mean, OK, many languages make it unnecessarily verbose and
    cumbersome to iterate over collections and/or ranges, but it's
    never more than some trivial syntax that's needed to lift that
    annoyance.  Be it with a <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro">hygienic macro</a>
    system, or built-in syntax like dozens of languages nowadays have.
    It's incomprehensible to me why someone would flaunt this as a
    major selling point of a language in this day and age.</p>

    <p>(Oh and would you look at that Wikipedia page; apparently
    Dylan, a previous language by Apple, had hygienic macros!
    Nowadays people don't know what they are, I'm not sure why, maybe
    because the overlords deemed the masses too stupid to make good
    use of them.)</p>

    <h3>Structs that support methods, extensions, protocols</h3>

    <p>So like any language supporting OOP?  After spending too much
    energy on the last point, I'm just going to shut up about
    this.</p>

    <h3>Functional programming patterns, e.g.: map and filter</h3>

    <p>Presumably McCarthy's original LISP had these. To give a
    concrete reference, have a <a href=
    "http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/MIT/Moon-MACLISP_Reference_Manual-Apr_08_1974.pdf"
    >MACLISP Reference Manual</a> from the freaking <em>Software
    Preservation Group</em>, because that thing is more or less
    literally a relic.  It's from 1974.  It's also what they first
    implemented Scheme on, so some good history there.  Page 33 has
    <em>delete</em> (like <em>filter</em>), page 83 explains
    <em>map</em>.  What, you thought functional programming was
    something new?</p>

    <p>On to other stuff.</p>

    <h2>Interactive Playgrounds</h2>

    <p>That section basically explains the development method used by
    Lisp users since times of yore.  The concept of a REPL which Swift
    mentions so proudly dates back once more to the oldest Lisp
    implementations.  Lisp machines and Smalltalk IDEs have long been
    praised for their interactivity.  So yeah, welcome to the 80s, or
    something.  I won't link to sources here, my head is hurting.</p>

    <h2>Designed for Safety</h2>

    <p>Under this section we see a lot of things listed which are the
    bread and butter of any modern high-level language.  And with
    modern I mean anything that popped up since ten years before my
    birth.  That is, the 80s, I'm not very old.</p>

    <h2>Fast and Powerful</h2>

    <p>If you compare Swift to languages like Perl, Python, Ruby, and
    JavaScript, it might seem nice that it's been designed with native
    compilation as a first-class goal despite seeming to be a
    "scripting language" kind of convenient, interactive language, but
    compiling properly high-level languages (which is to say I'm
    excluding "portable assembly" languages like C) to native code and
    getting high performance is surely nothing new; just look at
    OCaml, Haskell, or some Scheme implementations.  Especially Scheme
    in this case, since it's a similarly "scripty" language.  In any
    case, there is no innovation here.</p>

    <h1>Summary</h1>

    <p>Swift is not an innovative language.  It has nothing new, and I
    don't see it coming from any outstanding research background.
    Apple merely came up with an acceptably "modern" language to use
    instead of the disgusting cruft that is Objective-C.  If you want
    to see nifty new programming language features you might want to
    look at <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> instead,
    which actually came up with some ideas that seem to be new.</p>

    <p>Oh and:</p>

    <p><em>Indeed, one of my major complaints about the computer field
    is that whereas Newton could say, "If I have seen a little farther
    than others, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of
    giants," I am forced to say, "Today we stand on each other's
    feet." Perhaps the central problem we face in all of computer
    science is how we are to get to the situation where we build on
    top of the work of others rather than redoing so much of it in a
    trivially different way. Science is supposed to be cumulative, not
    almost endless duplication of the same kind of things.</em> --
