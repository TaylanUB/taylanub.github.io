<h1 class="title">What are macros?</h1>
</div>
<p>Some languages have a special syntax like the following:</p>
<pre><code>try {
  blah
} catch (FooException e) {
  blub
} finally {
  blip
}</code></pre>
<p>which executes <code>blah</code>, handles exceptions of type <code>FooException</code> with <code>blub</code>, and always calls <code>blip</code> to clean-up stuff at the end (no matter if an exception was raised or not), like closing a port that was opened in <code>blah</code>. (If we had called <code>close()</code> on that port at the end of <code>blah</code>, it might not be executed if an exception interrupts the flow of code.)</p>
<p>Now consider that your language does <em>not</em> have that <code>finally{}</code> syntax feature, and you're forced to do the following each time:</p>
<pre><code>try {
  blah
} catch (AnyException e) {
  if ( isFooException(e) ) {
    blub
  }
  blip
  if ( ! isFooException(e) ) {
    throw(e)
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This is incredibly annoying. Normally one can write functions to encapsulate common patterns of code, but can you write a function to encapsulate the above pattern? Difficult, eh?</p>
<p>(If your language supports first-class functions, you could actually write a <code>tryCatchFinally</code> function which takes three functions as its arguments, so this is not the best example (and should remind us that <em>many</em> situations where we think &quot;yay I'll use a macro!&quot; might be better served with a higher-order function, i.e. a function that takes other functions as arguments), but let's ignore that for a moment; there are often cases where even a higher-order function cannot encapsulate a common pattern of code.)</p>
<p>In a language without macros, you're forced to write repetitive code in many cases if the language doesn't have firsthand <em>syntactic</em> support to encapsulate a common coding pattern. But when you have macros, you can encapsulate those patterns. Macros don't take values as arguments, instead they take unexecuted <em>code snippets</em> (variable names, expressions, statements, etc.) as their arguments, and can inject code around those snippets to build common code patterns.</p>
<p>Macro definitions often use pattern-matching on the syntax of the language; the following pseudocode uses such a system, where the formal parameters of the <code>tryFin</code> macro definition are not necessarily identifiers (like the variable names in function parameters), and instead may be code templates:</p>
<pre><code>defineMacro tryFin(tryBody,
                   &lt;optional&gt; &#39;catch&#39; (ExcType excVar) { catchBody },
                   &#39;finally&#39; { finBody }) {
  try {
    tryBody
  } catch (AnyException e) {
    if ( isType(ExcType, e) ) {
      excVar = e
      catchBody
    }
    finBody
    if ( ! isType(ExcType, e) ) {
      throw(e)
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>(Assume that our macro system is so intelligent that it automatically deletes out the two if statements when the optional code-snippet argument has not been provided, because those if statements refer to identifiers that only appear in the optional parameter.)</p>
<p>(In this pseudocode I used <code>'singleQuoted'</code> identifiers to express those which are expected to appear verbatim as <em>keywords</em> in the argument snippets while calling the macro, instead of serving as template variables that get bound to (some part of) an argument snippet.)</p>
<p>Now you can write:</p>
<pre><code>tryFin({
  blah
}, catch (FooException e) {
  blub
}, finally {
  blip
})</code></pre>
<p>Ain't that neat?</p>
