Here's a funny little analogy I came up with to explain the difference
between interpreters and compilers:

Say I have a machine that I want to operate, but it's very
complicated.  (This is the CPU, the instructions are complicated.)

I have an engineer who can operate the machine; I can speak to them in
English and they figure out how to make the machine do that by
pressing some buttons as I speak.  (This engineer is the interpreter.)

But English is an inefficient language to communicate what to do with
the machine so it all takes long.  Since the engineer doesn't know the
full task beforehand and instead does it all in small translated steps
as I tell them the steps in English, it all takes very long.

A more efficient way is to first figure out the shortest sequence of
buttons to push to get the whole job done.  For this reason I have
another engineer who can understand my English and translate the whole
task I describe into the shortest possible sequence of button presses.
This engineer can't operate the machine as I speak since they first
need to hear the task from start to end, ponder on it a bit, and write
down the result somewhere, but later that result can be used by anyone
without that engineer around, and it will work very fast.  This
engineer is the compiler.
